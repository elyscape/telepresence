## Telepresence: local code in a remote Kubernetes cluster

Have you ever wanted the quick development cycle of local code while still having your code run within a remote Kubernetes cluster?
Telepresence allows you to run your code locally while still:

1. Giving your code access to Services in a remote Kubernetes cluster.
2. Giving your code access to cloud resources like AWS RDS or Google PubSub.
3. Allowing Kubernetes to access your code as if it were in a normal pod within the cluster.
4. Running your local code either as a normal process or inside a local Docker container.
